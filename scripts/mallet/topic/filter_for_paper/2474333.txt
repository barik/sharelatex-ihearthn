One of the lessons I took away from the static analysis tools I architected (PREfix and PREfast) was just how many bugs you can find with simple pattern-matching.To make it work in practice, you need some UX support -- including explanations (so in this case, making it clear that the results are undefined if the integer starts with a 0) and recommended fixes (specify the radix).  Otherwise, people are likely to dismiss the messages as a false positive.
