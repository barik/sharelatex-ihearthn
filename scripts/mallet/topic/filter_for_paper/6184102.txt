If you want to pitch Rust to the engine guys, you're going to be battling against their toolchains that have been developed for decades and have some of the best static analysis tools under the sun.I've never used static analysis tools for C++, but from what I've heard, the reason they need to be so advanced is because C++ is so difficult to analyse. Rust, on the other hand, with it's strong, static type system, may not even require extra static analysis tools to be used effectively.
