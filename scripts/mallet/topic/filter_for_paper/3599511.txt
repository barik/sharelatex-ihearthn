I'm a bit of an evangelical when it comes to static code analysis like this. I insist your code should work to a spec-- not necessarily Crockford's JSLint spec, but a spec, which is why I really like JSHint.But I find I can't really convince anyone of it being useful, I remember being in an interview for a startup I read about on here and started talking about this as a tool I use (they asked "What tools do you use"). They basically brushed it off as "yeah, I don't think this is super useful, we probably have bigger problems than a missing semicolon".As I understand it, general perception of people seems to be it's a tool for finding missing semicolons. I don't know how to give this a decent elevator pitch so other people can see the light.
