History says that security is a process, not a product (or artifact). I get it that C can be difficult. Pointers allow NULL dereferencing and use-after-free, strings are open to poor handling, etc. That said: we have OpenBSD w/ their re-written string/memory management and static and dynamic analysis tools with decades of development behind them.I'm more hesitant to crucify C than I feel others are... are we throwing out the baby with the bathwater ?To your comment -- that a  C program is probably not secure -- most code written (regardless of language) is probably junk, with different classes of errors. Its tough.
