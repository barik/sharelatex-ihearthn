That is true, but checking all the values of an enum is just the tip of the iceburg. Consider something as sophisticated as the second to last example in the post, where, because of pattern matching, I am able to to "flatten" an if and a switch into a single match. Since it is a single expression, the compiler can provide completeness checking on the _combination_ of the two. I am very curious if there are any static analysis tools that can provide that level of safety without pattern matching.
