Monkey patching is NOT widely accepted in Python, just the opposite. For an example look at gevent, which is actually quite useful and elegant but often panned and avoided in the Python community because it works by monkey patching. The same attitude is not equally present in every dynamic language.Where you are certainly right is that monkeypatching may occur in a project and this is only one of many ways that Python's being very dynamic makes it extra hard to write static analysis tools.The rm -rf problem is not as bad if you are previewing (say) a page view, which hopefully is not being developed on a production server and hopefully doesn't contain an rm -rf. But I agree that solving this in the general case is probably intractable without some kind of container.
