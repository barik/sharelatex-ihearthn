"There are loads of tools that should have never been implemented in C/C++ in the first place (SSH, Make, APT, etc.). I'd say the best idea is to port a lot of these code bases to languages like Go or Rust maybe, but if that's not feasible for some reason, at least write some unit tests and do static code analysis."This is the exact problem with everything today. Languages do not make bugs, people do. If that weren't the case, there wouldn't be bugs is python/ruby/shell/etc.Rewriting something is only guaranteeing that more bugs be created initially. And all the time and effort gets you..what? The same thing that was just patching in a different language. Awesome...You should be familiar with "bikeshed" being a freebsd user..
