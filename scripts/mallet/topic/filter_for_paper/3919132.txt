Static analysis is a method, not a goal. Static analysis in compilers is done for the purposes of optimization, so it is meaningless without a compiler. There are commercial and open source products that do static analysis to find logical errors and security vulnerabilities in your code like Klocwork, Coverity, or Gimpel Lint. There are formal verifiers. Decompilers, indenters and obfuscators can be considered sort of static analysis tools too, although on a shallower level.
