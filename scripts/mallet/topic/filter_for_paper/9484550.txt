NBD, I was being a little overzealous there myself. :) IME when most people say "static analysis" they're referring to tools that attempt to detect the usual class of memory vulnerabilities that Rust prevents outright (or maybe they do even worse and just attempt to detect typical coding patterns which happen to be correlated with the same).Part of my zeal is also that Rust's semantics are strictly, er, stricter than C's (disregarding the quagmire of C's undefined behavior), which means that static analysis tools should be even easier to write for it.
