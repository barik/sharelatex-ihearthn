In addition to your point, I'd like to stress that it is the game engines that are C++. Many engines provide a higher level interface for developers actually make games. You probably won't hook the game developers on Rust. If you want to pitch Rust to the engine guys, you're going to be battling against their toolchains that have been developed for decades and have some of the best static analysis tools under the sun. Not to mention, you'll also be battling against the traction of their current codebase, which they'll probably hesitant to rewrite in a new language. From a business perspective, I don't think management in some of the larger companies would let that decision fly, either.
