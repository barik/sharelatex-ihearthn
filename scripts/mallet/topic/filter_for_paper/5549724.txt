So, this might be naive, but for static information like the shared libs it's using, you might want to check out otool, and then pick up a good disassembler (I'm a fan of hopper, which is relatively cheap). For dynamic analysis you might want to check out the standard osx tools like netstat, and instrumentation tools like valgrind or gdb. gdb + breakpoints on choice system calls works pretty well on non-obfuscated binaries!
