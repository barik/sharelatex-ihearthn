Apple certainly has technical reasons for using clang; good luck getting the degree of integration XCode has with clang with GCC (the plugin system added as a response to clang existing would help, but would not be sufficient in itself). BSD has less clear ones, though I would hope that other C/C++ IDEs will start adding similar levels of integration.Ultimately, clang offers a way forward without having to adopt GPLv3 software, and besides that offers considerable benefit to people making development tools. Its big selling point has never really been speed; that it can generally keep up is enough.EDIT: You could certainly also make the claim that Clang's far faster compilation is a technical feature, especially for C++ programmers. There are actually people who use clang for development, for the fast compilation and static analysis, then build for production with a newish GCC.
