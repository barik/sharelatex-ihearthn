Believe it or not, I do.I really enjoy using various tools like static analysis programs and memory checkers to ferret out the offending bits of code, figuring out why they're broken, and fixing them.It gives me a certain sense of satisfaction to finally conquer a bug.  Particularly when it's a really tricky bug I've been bashing my head against for days.Then again, when I've been after a given bug for days it can get really frustrating, and I don't enjoy the frustration.And it's not like my dream job is doing nothing but fixing bugs.  I also enjoy architecting new systems, learning new concepts, and applying them during the quest to complete a project.I suppose a healthy mix of tasks, from architecture, to writing new code, to fixing bugs is ideal.But what I really hate is writing documentation.  I know it's necessary.  And my (non-throwaway) code has quite a lot of comments in it because I know it's necessary and good practice.  But it can get quite tedious.I'd much rather bugfix than write documentation.
