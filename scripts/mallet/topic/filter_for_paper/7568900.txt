Even easier, I would bet a lot of money that they have at least some rudimentary static analysis tools to detect potential targets, and this sort of memory error is pretty low hanging fruit for such a tool. To me it seems almost certain that they knew about it and they certainly exploited it if they knew.The bigger question to me is how many of these bugs have they rooted out that have not been made public yet?
