First of all ReSharper C++ offers ~60 real-time code inspections. Things like unreachable code, hiding local declarations, dependent type without 'typename' keyword, non-inline function definition in a header file, boost::format with too many or too few arguments, invalid printf format specifiers, redundant keywords ('else', 'static', 'template' etc).Quick-fixes are provided for many of the inspections so that if you want to act on an inspection, you can have R# C++ do the editing for you.AFAIK Visual Assist has very limited code analysis capabilities.Refactorings/transformations such as "Substitute macro call", "Initialize field from constructor parameter", "Merge nested if statements", "Replace redundant parentheses", "Move method implementation out of class scope" or "Replace 'auto' with explicit type" are also unique to ReSharper C++ AFAIK.Also I don't think VAX has navigation to derived/base symbols or specializations.Some of the things that VAX has but R# C++ doesn't include Document method, auto-inserting underscores after 'm' and Header hierarchy view.Here's how a dev on the R# C++ team has summarized differences between the tools in a comment last year: http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/29k4fb/resharper_for_c_...(Disclaimer: I'm with JetBrains, the company behind ReSharper C++.
