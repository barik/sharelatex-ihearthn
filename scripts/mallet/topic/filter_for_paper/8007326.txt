Actually, I think I'm just having more of this conversation in my head than I am in this forum.  For better and worse. :)My point here was more that just because you have a file handle doesn't mean you have a valid place to write data.  Making it optional would possibly prevent some bugs, true.  However, it doesn't really help as soon as you have a filehandle to a full filesystem, for example.  (Or, well, any other problem that usually happens to cause grief with the filesystems.  You got a file, but by the time you went to use it the system was full and you couldn't, etc.)Regardless, I should have been clearer on many points (and I fully accept I was flat out wrong on at least a few :) ).  I do think null pointers are bad.  I also know with proper static analysis tools, you don't need a whole new type system to make things better.  Unless you are considering tools such as Coverity and friends some form of type system.
