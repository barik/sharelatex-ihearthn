The difference isn't between the systems, it's a difference in tooling, in that Hack comes with its own type checker. Part of the motivation for PHP 7's expanded type hinting support was to enable better static analysis tools. I expect we'll see something similar to Hack's type checker for PHP 7 in not too long. Actually, some IDEs already check types, I think.Of course, a tool for PHP 7 can only go so far, because PHP 7's type hints aren't sufficient to cover everything, unlike Hack which has things like nullable support.
