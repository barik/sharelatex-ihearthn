The article is about static analysis. Static analysis is the most efficient way to catch a whole host of bugs. Testing would be a waste of everyone's time for these types of bugs. Now, the tools in the article are commercial and perform static analysis on C and C++. Other programming languages have static analysis and code path coverage analysis built into their compilers. Many of those languages are free. Writing tests to cover those types of bugs is time wasted on a problem that is already solved.
