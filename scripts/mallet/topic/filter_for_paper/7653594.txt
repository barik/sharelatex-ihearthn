> lack of module systemES6 fixes this with, well, a module system.> weak-typing,Yup, this is a problem.> verbose function syntax,ES6 fixes this with arrow functions.> late bindingDoes this just mean dynamic typing? Well, yes, JavaScript is dynamically typed, but I wouldn't call that a language flaw. Static vs. dynamic typing is a tradeoff.> which has led to the creation of various static analysis tools to alleviate this language flawThe footnote talks about JSLint and friends, but none of those impose a type system, which means that they do nothing about dynamic typing.> but with limited success (there is even a static type checker)Well, yeah. It's very hard (read: "research problem") to impose a good static typechecker on a dynamically typed system, though.> finicky equality/automatic conversionYeah, this is bad. I really wish tools like restrict mode [1] had caught on: together with ES6 they eliminate a lot of what people dislike about JavaScript.> this behaviour,Fixed in ES6 if you use arrow functions (finally!)> and lack of static types.Again, I wouldn't say it "sucks" for this reason, just that it's dynamically typed. That's a tradeoff.[1]: http://restrictmode.org/
