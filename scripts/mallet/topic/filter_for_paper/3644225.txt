We've been building a SPICE-like mixed-mode circuit simulator plus a SVG-based schematic editor, HTML5/Canvas-based plotting, in about 20K lines of CoffeeScript.  No browser plugins required -- runs directly in the browser's JavaScript engine, and all simulation is client-side.  (We generate and factor big matrices on the client side.)  We currently do DC, time-domain simulations, and frequency-domain analysis (small signal, "Bode plots" if you're familiar with the lingo).  Circuit analysis results compare well to "real" desktop SPICEs.  We evaluate real and complex electrical quantities.  In fact, we have a graphing calculator essentially embedded in our tool.  Since it's browser-based, it's immediately Windows/Mac/Linux cross-platform, unlike most software EDA tools which are Windows-only.  Check out the cross-tab copy-paste functionality as well!If you look at any electronics forum online, it's normal to see scanned hand-drawn schematics, or static screenshots from various desktop tools. There's no reason why we shouldn't instead be sharing useful URLs that enable editing and simulation.  If someone uses CircuitLab and posts a public URL, they enable the entire community to easily open their circuit, make a few changes, simulate / iterate, and share the new version.Looking forward to hearing your feedback!
