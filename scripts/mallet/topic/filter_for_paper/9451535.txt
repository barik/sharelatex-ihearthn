It is really interesting. You pointed that the static analysis tools are aimed at developers but even the guys from PVS-Studio admit their main customers are big companies with teams of developers and I agree. From my experience such companies "force" their developers to use these kind of tools. It is somehow paradoxical that such tools are so technical only developers understand their results but only managers want (or think they want) to consume them.
