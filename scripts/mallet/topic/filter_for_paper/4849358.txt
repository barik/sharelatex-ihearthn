I am a firm believer that the best way to fix programming is through better programming languages, which I learned about myself while working at Coverity. Otherwise I think it was a great place to work: lots of very smart people, a very good business plan, great startup stock (back then), but I'm too idealistic!Static analysis tools are very pragmatic in a world where better languages aren't adopted very often.
