Maybe it's just me, but I was under the impression that working on internal tools was one of the best places to be, at least at primarily software-based companies.  You're insulated from whatever invariably boring domain your company happens to serve, you have far more range to innovate and try new technologies, you don't have to deal with customers who aren't also developers...A disproportionate amount of interesting projects I've read about and seen were internal tools of various sorts: compilers, static analysis, testing, verification, building. If I was going to work at a big company like Google or Facebook, I would definitely prefer to be on a tools team.Also, I think working at a financial company like Jane Street would be great, and that is also an internal sort of job. Really, the company doesn't have any external customers at all. Yet I'd go there over virtually any other standard software engineering sort of job.
