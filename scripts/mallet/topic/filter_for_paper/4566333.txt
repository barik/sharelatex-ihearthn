Real eye opener for me. Been coding for 30 years and have not heard of hardly any of these things. I'm sure this is focussed mainly on web/social/mobile developers but I would have thought there's more overlap with traditional app development and embedded development, which is what I'm doing.My favorite tools:- Keil IDE + Eclipse, Visual Studio- Coverity for static analysis- git and SVN on our own servers- Jenkins for CI- homegrown unit testing framework- RallyDev for trackingWhat I'm seeing on the list from the article is a lot of online tools for faster collaboration. That's really where I can see traditional development models could learn from the web crowd.
