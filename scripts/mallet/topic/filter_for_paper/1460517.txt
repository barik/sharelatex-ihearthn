Do we really want to heed advice when it's comes with obviously wrong advice like "Only people can detect and solve software bugs, not tools."Static bug analysis is definitely not the be all and end all of software quality but definitely has a place. We automatically run FindBugs (along with unit test etc) on our code base every time new code is pushed by a developer and it definitely helps pick up quirky little errors much more cheaply than code reviews.
