Not really; I was highlighting that every editor is not going to add support for every new javascript framework's proprietary implementations. There are tons of tools out there for JavaScript that you can run on any plain JavaScript, and almost none for all these syntaxes.I don't just mean code-completion and debugging, but things like validators/linters and other static analysis tools; code coverage, formatting, refactoring.It's not a good use of time for every IDE to try and implement every one of these for every crazy JS framework.If we stick to using languages as they're intended (and defined), we'd have full coverage for these tools.
