Microsoft's code quality evangelism pains me a bit. With one hand they publish articles like this and add tools to Visual Studio to help with code quality (e.g. adding static code analysis to VS2012 Express and later). And with the other hand they go "haha fuck you" and arbitrarily lock out some code quality tools unless you're using Visual Studio Ultimate. (my Visual Studio with MSDN Premium isn't enough, it seems.)"Smart Unit Tests" [1] is the most recent in a long list of things tucked away in Ultimate.[1] https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn823749(v=vs.140).aspx
