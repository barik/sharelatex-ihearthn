I realize there's a philosophy that it's best to start from the lowest levels and work one's way up. It's one I can empathize with, in spirit, though I disagree.The same logic means that people shouldn't use static code analysis tools, or valgrind, or even debuggers, until they acquire deep technical knowledge. While I think all of these tools help reinforce the principles.If someone starts with the fixed and unwavering goal of security analysis in mind, then perhaps I can agree with you. If however someone is only curious about security analysis, and finds that spending a year to "grok the theory" is a high barrier, then even clumsy use of semi-automated tools may provide more concrete incentive to learn the underlying skills.While I don't believe you are correct, another question is, how many white hats do we end up with? Even if it takes 2 years to learn security skills by using automation, and only 1 year without automation, if after 10 years there are 500 following your path, while 10,000 following my path, then that's a net gain for the good side, yes? (I assume that there is such a thing as "good enough", and that it's relatively stable. Obviously if there is only a market for 500, and your 500 are always better than my 10,000 then that changes the dynamics.)Finally, it's also good to have even the script kiddies on the side of good than the side of lolz.
