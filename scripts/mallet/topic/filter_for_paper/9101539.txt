I would say both are correct.  From a psychological\SE standpoint know your faults and develop defenses for them. That could be use a language that doesn't allow them to even be thought in the first place, or develop defensive coding standards that prevent them.  But that answer is more stochastic, it helps but anything short of formal proof is just raising the likely hood of success not a guarantee.I also wonder if a static analysis tool would have caught the bug.  Are there any good static analysis tools for Java or Python that might have caught the bug without the overhead of writing the formal proof?
