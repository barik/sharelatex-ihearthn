Oops. I was doing this from an iPad, and iOS Safari is extremely bad at rendering source code (it's plain text, so it wraps it. It also chooses an incredibly large font size, so lines wrap at 50 characters or so in portrait mode. That made me bail out early, after reading this and not spotting the SRVR = SERVER abbreviation:    clientRandom.data = ctx->clientRandom;\n    clientRandom.length = SSL_CLIENT_SRVR_RAND_SIZE;\n    serverRandom.data = ctx->serverRandom;\n    serverRandom.length = SSL_CLIENT_SRVR_RAND_SIZE;\n\nThat is something that I think static analysis tools could signal. It would be a red herring, though.
