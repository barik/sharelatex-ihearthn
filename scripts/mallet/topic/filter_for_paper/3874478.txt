I'm a bit unconvinced about the 'language agnostic' assumption.For Java, you want to get the most out of your static typing. So, you need an IDE filled with analysis tools.For dynamically typed languages, Eclipse doesn't cut it. It gets sluggish and crashes too often and that's not acceptable when your language is designed for rapid feedback.I want something that gives me feedback as if I were using Firebug, but feels like I'm typing into Notepad++, and it seems like LightTable could fill that need.My thinking is that Light Table will live or die by how responsive it feels.
