Maybe the silver lining here is that it puts the final nail in the coffin for "many eyes make all bugs shallow" - which was always total BS from the day it was uttered.  There's so much code out there, much of it highly specialized and even project-specific, that there are very few eyes looking at any particular piece of code, and not all eyes are connected to the greatest of brains.Most static code analyzers could have caught this particular bug, as it requires only a fairly simple kind of reasoning about allocated vs. used length. In fact I believe it probably was found by static analysis before being reported by a human, which is a shame because it misses an opportunity to highlight the value of such tools.  Maybe next time people will spend a little less time designing a logo and a little more time doing things that actually help (though that's a wish and what I expect is the exact opposite).The real lesson here is that we should apply as many different tools and processes as we can at improving code quality for critical infrastructure.  Code reviews are nice.  Static analysis is nice.  Detailed tests are nice.  However, none of these alone is sufficient even when pursued with fanatical devotion.
