>Do they let plumbers operate on patients because it's now much safer? Not where I live, the laws are pretty strict with respect to who can practice medicine.But there aren't laws that determine who can program...>If you want safety, stop thinking in terms of blame and vengeance and design systems that avoid errors, and reduce their impact if they occur. This includes culture, processes and tools to protect against errors by those who do the work, and some regulation to stop management from putting employees in situations where they are likely to cause harm.There obviously already are systems that are designed to avoid errors... Unit testing, static code analysis, automatic formatting, etc.The author of the article said to throw all those out and put all of the safeguards into the language spec. OP is just saying that they don't belong there.
