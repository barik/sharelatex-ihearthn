There's a lot to be said for keeping things as simple as possible. Although what qualifies as simple varies from application to application.I was doing some preliminary analysis for a small project recently, and considering various frameworks and tools. Eventually I realized I could implement what was needed using four JSPs producing static html, with a bit of styling in CSS. No AOP, no injection framework, no JavaScript. And no explicit differentiation between device types.The resulting application will start up quickly -- which is important when running in a PaaS environment -- and should work on any browser, including weird old stuff like Lynx. Less butterfly. More rat.
