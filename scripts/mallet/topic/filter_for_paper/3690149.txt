Yes, because you can be swamped in false positives so much that it's easier on time, money and nerves to just not use the tool.
And this is a general problem in static source code analysis, not just the "bad tools".I had this awesome example in one book about metrics where the static analysis on some 100k LOC project produced output with the same line length as "War and Peace". Good luck sifting through those.But I'm absolutely not saying you shouldn't use them, but as some commenters in the original post pointed out, you need to check if they produce sensible output for your project or if they can catch some really nasty bugs, if it's worth the additional work.
