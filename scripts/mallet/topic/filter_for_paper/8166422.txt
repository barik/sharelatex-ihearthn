This is a pretty interesting concept, but the site doesn't do a good job of explaining exactly what it does. A realistic step-by-step example would help a lot. Is it doing some kind of static analysis, or is it looking at the object graph at some specified point in the program's execution?I think it would be really useful to have a tool that visualizes execution paths of programs to help you understand the general architecture of someone else's project. I believe debugging tools are able to do this to some extent, but I haven't seen anything that exactly fits, especially for JS. I would want to be able to do some interaction (e.g. mouse click) and see a visualization summarizing all the lines of code that were run without stepping through them one-by-one. Maybe this is a direction that PojoViz could go in eventually.
