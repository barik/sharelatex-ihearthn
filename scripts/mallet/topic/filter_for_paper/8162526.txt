Using a language with a more powerful type system (e.g. Haskell) you can derive the same benefits as you would from static analysis tools, but integrated with the rest of your development tools, extensible, and supported by other users of the same language (e.g. library writers). So I think most people who appreciate the benefits tend to move on from C (particularly given how large the library ecosystem in safer languages is these days).
