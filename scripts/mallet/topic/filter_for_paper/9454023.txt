Hmmm?  I'm not sure what you mean by "books and book packages", but as a small developer I've certainly bought development tools priced under $100.  That's a sort of dividing line for me, though -- I don't think I've ever purchased development software priced over $100 unless I absolutely had to.And yeah, Windows-only static analysis software priced at $250 would be a very hard sell for me...
