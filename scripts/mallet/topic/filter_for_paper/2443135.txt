I don't know any thing about CoffeeScript, but static analysis tools like the Google Closure Compiler can help you take care of global variable problems and a whole lot more. Using Closure Compiler, you are forced to document your code with their enhanced version of jsDocs, so CC will make sure that if your method returns null or a list of strings, that anywhere that method is used, you don't try to treat the returned value as a string or object, for instance.How does coffee script play with existing object oriented JS libraries? Is there compile-time type checking?
