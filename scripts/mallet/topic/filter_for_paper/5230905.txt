Why do they use strings as function using to-function
(https://github.com/component/to-function).
Like .select("age>10").map("adress.streetname");While to-function is cool and your code is shorter and more readable. You must be aware that you miss- static code analysis such as synax checking
- compile time optimizations (because the AST is missing)
- static code analysis tools
- code coverage checking toolsI would recommend using real functions, or using clojurescript or coffeescript in order to get shorter code.
