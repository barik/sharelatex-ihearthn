In general, why has static analysis not been more popular?  When I first ran FindBugs on a 50 KLOC codebase I inherited, it identified several real, non-trivial bugs which likely hurt many users.  Perhaps the average Java developer's skill level is too low to make sense of these tools' results?  But, one would think that most teams have at least one "adult" who would love more visibility into a codebase.
