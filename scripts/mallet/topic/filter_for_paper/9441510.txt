Maybe the MISRA-C industry standard practices are ridiculous, out of touch and impractical.I currently work in the static analysis industry. Broadly speaking, the MISRA-C ruleset is, in my experience and in the experience of many customers who apply it, not impractical, clearly of benefit, and the majority of rule violations (including a number of rules violated by Toyota) easily found with static analysis tools.I even know that Toyota is a customer of (at least) one of the static analysis tool companies (obviously Toyota is a huge company, and I've no idea if the specific muppets making this clusterf had any static analysis tools; just that Toyota as a company definitely has someone buying them). It seems that they either just didn't use it, or just didn't care (or were told not to care).As an extra point of data, I sit opposite someone who is on the MISRA-C committee. He is a solid C coder who knows a great deal about the language and how to get it wrong. His day job is writing/maintaining static analysis tools for C programmes. Obviously this is no guarantee that the committee as a whole is good at maintaining the MISRA-C ruleset, but they do have at least one active, experienced and competent C coder (with lots of experience of having to actually automate detection of rule violations) at the table.
