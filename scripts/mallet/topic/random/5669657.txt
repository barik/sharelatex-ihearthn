What I find very positive about clang/llvm is:- Everyone now seems to be using LLVM for language prototyping instead of JVM/.NET, clearly positive for native compilation and to show people without compiler knowledge that managed != VM- The compiler as a library implementation of clang allows C, C++ and Objective-C to enjoy tooling support similar to JVM and .NET languages- As someone with a sweet spot for the strong typing found in the Pascal family, the integrated static analysis are just great
