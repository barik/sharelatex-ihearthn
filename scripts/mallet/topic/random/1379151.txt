"Pretty severe" lack of professionalism?  It's not unprofessional not to turn the warnings all the way up and sift through each and every one.  Some of us work code inherited from other people with different coding guidelines, and some of the warnings will generate loads of messages for code that is not only technically correct but stylistically correct as well.  The unused parameter warning is one of the biggest offenders in this area.  And if you have a hundred warnings for unused parameters, which ones do you pay attention to?Another potential issue is that the code in the patch might almost never be called in the first place.  Most libc implementations (three that I know of, where I've examined the "memset" source) have a "memset" like that as a fallback only for platforms without an assembly version.I'd say the problem is that there are several different ways this error could have been detected sooner: warnings, test, static analysis tools, and review, but none of them worked.  But again, it's also possible that the code is never called because assembly versions are always available.
