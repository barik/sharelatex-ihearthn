This is great news! When I was at MSR I heard the rumor that they wanted to sell Z3, not open-source it!Some context, as not everybody may have heard about it.Z3 is an SMT [1] solver. Since SMT generalizes SAT, it is clearly NP-hard, so a number of heuristics are needed. In particular, Z3 won several SMT speed competitions, so it has been for long the fastest SMT solver.You can play with it online using its Lisp-like native language [2] or using the Python bindings [3]The reason SMT is important is that several static analysis tools work by encoding the program constraints (such as pre/post conditions, invariants, ...) into a big formula. The satisfiability of this formula determines the correctness of the program, and sometimes assignments can be translated back to counterexamples to program correctness.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories[2] http://rise4fun.com/Z3/bit-count[3] http://rise4fun.com/Z3Py/nonlinear
