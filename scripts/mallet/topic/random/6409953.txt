I'm sure malicious code can be hidden in plain site anyway.  Automated tools or human eyeballs won't spot it.  For example here is the underhanded C contest demonstrating the principle with C http://underhanded.xcott.com/  (static analysis won't be possible on most JS code)The only way to be sure is to implement a (bug free) sandbox that the code runs in, as then it won't matter what the code does.
