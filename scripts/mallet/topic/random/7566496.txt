It would shock me if those tools would actually have caught this bug.  That would imply that no benevolent contributor or researcher had run them against OpenSSL in the last two years, which I find incredibly hard to believe, as static analysis is a logical first step in researching a code for vulnerabilities, and OpenSSL is probably in the top 5 most valuable pieces of software to validate.
