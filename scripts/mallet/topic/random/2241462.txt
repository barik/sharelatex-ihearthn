I love developing in rails but let's be clear, refactoring ruby is just painful at the moment. Yesterday I decided to rename a model, it took over an hour to get the tests passing again. Ok there's rubymine but it's only partially effective, it misses things like renaming relationships and references in templates. Given the difficulty of static analysis I've been wondering if a refactoring tool might look a little different with a dynamic language. Given that refactorings are effectively replacement patterns perhaps a find/replace workflow tool would be the way to go. The workflow might go something like: specify broad regex which matches all potential changes. View matches and then partition them with further rules like file type and tighter regexes. Once you've grouped the matches provide appropriate replacements. Run tests. Refine if required. Obviously you could follow this workflow using command line tools but the refinement process is difficult because you don't retain any of the context.  Having said that it wouldn't be too hard to use existing commands to put something like this together. Looks I've got a project for this afternoon.
