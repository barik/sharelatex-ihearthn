roughly 50%  of my current duties involve parsing and transforming an AST. As well as performing static analysis.All of it is to support web developers by giving them tools to handle html and css well. But this is not the usual case for my career much of it has been exactly what you describe instead.I'm just glad that I knew enough of this stuff to be able to tackle these problems when there was a need to.
