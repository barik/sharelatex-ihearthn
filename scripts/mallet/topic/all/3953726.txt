Just because C++ is a superset of C doesn't make it strictly better.  The presence of additional features can be a liability.  The obvious problem is that if you want to use the C subset in a multi-person project (whose team evolves over time), you have to create a way to enforce that.  Another example is that it's more difficult to produce static analysis tools like lint.  (As an example, lint in C detects unused stack variables.  This is trivial for C.  This is extremely difficult for C++ because the mere construction of the object on the stack often has important side effects.)
