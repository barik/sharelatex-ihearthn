I did not know about KeYmeara. Looks great!While I'm not sure if we may count those as "programmation by contract", some Java tools provide (some) static analysis:- Findbugs- IntelliJ IDEA does some nullness analysis : http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/howto.html- JSR 305 (Annotations for Software Defect Detection in Java) attempted to standardize on a set of annotations. We use it in our project, mainly the @Nonnull at the moment... I believe Findbugs considers these annotations.- CodePro Analytix, also recently open sourced by Google, might also do some static analysis: http://code.google.com/javadevtools/codepro/doc/index.html- Eclipse might too (any expert Eclipse user knows?)I think there is still a lot to do in this space. "Contracts for Java" is a step in the right direction :)
