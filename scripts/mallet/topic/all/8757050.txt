Interesting work, but I wish they had put a date on it.  The fact that they were working with the 2.6.15 kernel suggests that the work is old now.  Certainly you will find few bugs that are fixable in the current kernel by looking at 2.6.15!My suspicion is that this work is abandoned at this point, which is too bad.  The last release tarball is over four years old...  We could really use better static analysis tools, but so much of this stuff never seems to escape academia.
