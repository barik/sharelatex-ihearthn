Unfortunately, JSLint objects strongly to using 'new foo()' without assigning the result to anything, which is a pain if you're using Prototype AJAX since firing off an AJAX request is done by calling 'new Ajax.Request(url, options)'. The only way to get around this seems to be to put parentheses around the statement - there's no way to turn most individual checks on or off, unlike other static analysis tools I've used like PMD and FindBugs.I still use it - because that trailing-comma-in-hash-definition issue in IE is really annoying.
