Inevitably, that is what is attempted. But it doesn't solve the use cases I mentioned.To take a diff for example, not only do you need to illustrate the diff version of (I drew a new line from here to here and made this other box green), you would also need to illustrate patches to textual details and how they related to the graphical code.Maybe I can imagine a solution that could do that (at great expense). I cannot imagine the language being friendly enough that third-party compilers, IDEs, or static-analysis tools would be feasible.
