I'm with you on the type checking (although this particular library doesn't seem to offer much in that space). That said, I'd argue that modern tooling (e.g. IDEA, and by association the static analysis toolchain in Teamcity) are capable of identifying and validating embedded SQL, particularly when provided with database metadata.Essentially, I'm deeply uneasy about embedding translators from one language into another. As an example, not many people like using BigDecimal to describe arithmetic operations, despite it having a fluent syntax and improved type safety (e.g. around implicit conversions) compared to just writing an expression.
