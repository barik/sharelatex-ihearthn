This is full static analysis, with AST and type inference.However, type inference on JavaScript is quite hard, and as you've seen, our analyzer fails on many complex libraries like d3. We have an open issue about fixing d3 support at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph.com/issues/13, which you can +1 if you want to stay updated on. And we're releasing the analysis toolkit we use as open source soon so it's not bottlenecked on us.
