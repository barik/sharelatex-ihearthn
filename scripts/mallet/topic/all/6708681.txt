And users of dynamically typed languages will sometimes argue that the need for code generation tools is less necessary. You lose the ability to have tools do a lot of the work, but you also lose the need to have tools do a lot of the work. It's a trade off.Type [an]notations are also useful for compilers when generating performant code. But projects like pypy and V8 (javascript) show that a well written interpreter can do run-time analysis, and generate performant code, just like a static analysis.
