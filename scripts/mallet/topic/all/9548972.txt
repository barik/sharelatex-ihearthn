Also, well done Cliche, that's pretty neat; there are some other implementations of this idea nowadays that do similar things and are very useful.[0]One of the reasons I love HHVM is that Hack is basically PHP-the-good-parts-with-other-awesome-good-parts-added. Static analysis? No problem. Autocomplete? Built into the default tooling! Having to remember dirty array method parameter ordering? No need -- use Collections and use methods on the primitives![0] https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser
