The difference between engineering and tinkering is discipline.Not to say tinkering is bad, its perfectly fine when trying to create the latest viral app or when learning how to do something. When engineering something, discipline is required.And nothing stops any institution seriously committed to engineering to adopting practices that restrict language use to a subset (mandatory code review, static analysis tools that highlight deviant code and disallow it to be pushed, etc).
