Tooling should get us part of the way - it surely cannot be that difficult to interactively show which interfaces a type satisfies (and conversely, what you'd need to add to a type to have it satisfy an interface).In general it would be neat if the "go" command supported some more advanced static analysis stuff beyond go fix, fmt, and vet.A lot of this stuff could be done by reflect -- if only there was a repl!
