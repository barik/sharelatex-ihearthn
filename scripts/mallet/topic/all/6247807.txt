programming will be much more of a two-way conversation with your tooling.Do you have any experience programming in Haskell? I ask because this statement exactly describes my experience with it. The language goes extremely far down the path of "static analysis" with its type system. Couple this with simple tools such as ghci, flymake and haskell-mode for emacs and you have a very interactive system with an enormous amount of feedback.
