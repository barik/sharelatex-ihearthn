My one experience with the Tox project was that I made a few (I thought) constructive suggestions. First, I suggested they use some form of static analysis or perhaps a 'safer' language to implement their core functionality - such as Rust or Go, instead of rather messy (at the time) C code.Furthermore, having spent a lot of time researching parsers and how parser differentials can affect the security of systems, I suggested they use some tools, such as protocol buffers, to eliminate handwritten parsing code. The response I got was rather disheartening and downright hostile - it boiled down to the fact that protocol buffers involves C++ code which they are a priori against, without actually engaging in a factual argument  (I wrote an article in the current USENIX login/ last years OSDI about parsers for binary protocols  for anyone interested in background: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14... and github.com/jbangert/nail)
