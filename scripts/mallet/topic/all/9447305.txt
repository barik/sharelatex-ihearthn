Well, unless I've missed something, it is by definition static analysis -- so that's probably a good start.The way I look at it is that every minute you spend discussing a point in a review that could have been caught/corrected by a static tool is a minute wasted.  But these tools can't do any of the actual work of the review.By the way, linting is a fairly well known term with a long history, but it wouldn't surprise me if there are communities that don't know the term.
