> I do not subscribe to the reasoning that Tests immediately cause a bad designMe neither. But tests are given much, much more attention than they are worth. Tests mainly make up for lack of clean structure and good tooling for static analysis. Strong static typing is worth attention. Static analysers and code proof assistants are worth attention. Simple design that make whole class of errors impossible is worth it. Tests are not worth that much in this neighbourhood.Having plenty of tests is OK when the code base is fragile and it's not clear how to make it robust. Tests are a tool of last resort, if all thinking fails to produce something bug-resistant.
