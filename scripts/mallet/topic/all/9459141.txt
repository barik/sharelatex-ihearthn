Well, I am very interested in parsing and static analysis and if you idea and suggestions feel free to open as many tickets as you want on the project.Yes, Hoogle is super cool, it would be definitely useful to have something like that.I wrote in the past tools to manipulate ASTs of several languages but I have never looked in a Scala parser. Can you suggest one?
