Sure, there are complexities like that in the world. However, where programmer A writes an if-else statement or, maybe, a 5-line dynamic dispatch, programmer B installs some "enterprise" framework or a rules engine, instantly making the entire system an order of magnitude more complex.What programmers like B often doesn't realize is that they push core logic of the application from their source code (Turing complete, expressive, versioned, benefiting from static and dynamic analysis and all the testing/refactoring tools available for the language) into an obscure XML notation or even some proprietary rules database, worked upon by a complicated blob of 3d party code that has nothing to do with the original business problem.
