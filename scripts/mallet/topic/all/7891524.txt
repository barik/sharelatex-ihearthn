No we weren't.  We were talking about "being less bug prone" and "easier to read."Though, I'm not entirely sure that really changes much.  :(Look, I'm not against static typing.  I confess to being somewhat in love with lisp at the moment.  And, I'm trying to learn MIXAL for some unholy reason.  At the same time, I try to type my systems as well as I can.  I am far from convinced that typing will be the way to go.Especially if you consider auxiliary tools.  Having used Coverity some, it is down right impressive the stability you can bring to a C codebase with proper discipline and the appropriate tooling.  Compared to using something such as a Scala codebase, where right now your only recourse is the compiler.That is, static analysis does not begin and end with the compiler.  Sadly, in moving to "newer" statically typed languages, you through out many of the tools that currently exist in the older languages.And this is not just for "correctness".  Having finally added "-march=native" to my flags for a build of software, I'm literally amazed at how well optimized a compile can be versus just using "-O3".  Optimizations in the modern world are quite amazing without necessarily needing "better types."
