C itself is also scary. Most other languages provide at least run-time safety; some provide great compile-time safety. C providing neither and being the most popular language for system software is what is really scary.I guess part of what is scary about C is that it gives you the illusion of a high-level language, but unless you know all UB by heart, you might accidentally start working in assembly.Isn't there at least a flag that activates warnings for stuff like this? I tried -Wall in both clang and gcc and they didn't say jack shit.What do modern C developers do these days? Arm themselves with expensive advanced static analysis tools to their teeth?
