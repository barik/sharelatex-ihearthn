Good point! When asking developers about their use of static code analysis to ensure code quality we found that most development teams use such tools only sporadically or not at all, and just very few teams have a systematic process or set of guidelines for ensuring code quality throughout all of their projects. So while some technologies already exist for this, we definitely think that there's room for more.
