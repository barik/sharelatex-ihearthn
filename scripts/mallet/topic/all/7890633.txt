Generally, statically typed languages are less bug prone  than dynamically typed languages. Dynamically typed languages are OK for smaller projects but as projects grow in size, you have to write a lot of tests to be sure that everything works.Also, projects written in statically typed languages are easier to read and navigate for humans and it's also easier to write static analysis tools for them.
