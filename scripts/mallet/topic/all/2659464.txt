I'm used to pricing for commercial embedded tools, which is rarely this straightforward or inexpensive. I'm not saying that's a good thing, but that's why I found this "cheap". Of course, I can't really speak to its value without having evaluated it. The "only" qualifier presumed it's a comprehensive, commercially-supported static analysis tool that I would find valuable, but the call for actual users' opinions was my first step in testing this presumption. I'm installing it now.
