It's not that simple, because of inlining and macros.Those optimizations can be used to quickly throw out unnecessary code like null-pointer checks inside inlined functions, so they are valuable and good to have.So it's a matter of how much energy you spend on diagnostics, which ends up a rather heuristic field and perhaps we'd just be better off focusing on better static analysis tools that are separate from or can otherwise be decoupled from compilers.
