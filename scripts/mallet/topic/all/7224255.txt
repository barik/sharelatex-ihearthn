If you want reasons other than negligence.The biggest reason is likely universities: I was there not too long ago (6-7 years), I wrote code that was secure against SQL injection - which lost me marks. They teach you to write insecure code and so help you God if you don't stick to what they have taught you.Secondly is human error - that's to do with buffer overflows etc. You might say that we have static analysis, but...Thirdly is that our static analysis tools simply are not "there" yet. They will catch the vast majority of vulnerabilities (especially when coupled together with contracts) but there are those corner cases that only a very creative security analyst will find.Honestly though, if I was ever in a fire/hire position bringing SQL-injectable-code to a code review would be grounds for being fired on the spot.
