Yet you're using:C# - A language that can do (almost) everything: mobile, web, desktop, etc (Java still beat you guys on embedded devices).VS.NET - An IDE that can do build, run your tests, UML modelling and many more...Final thoughts on Maven: What I care is a tool that perform build for me and in 2013, validations are part of the build: validate that your code compiles (compiler), validate that your code can be packaged according to the agreeable standard (dll, jar, whatever), some level of behaviour validation (unit-test, integration-test) .If you disagree then perhaps we have philosophical differences when it comes to good software engineering practices since the beginning.Eventually you either: build something from scratch to mimic Maven on .NET ecosystems or use various tools (MSBuild, NAnt, NuGET) that perform the same workflow that Maven gives to you. Either way you got nothing like Maven in .NET ecosystems which is a huge loss for me since why would I learn various tools or build some piece of the puzzles on my own when I have _the_ tool that can do what we all have to do on day-to-day base anyway...You're not saying anything remotely close to display how the .NET ecosystem is richer than Java. Perhaps because it isn't.PS: Maven is composed by plugins, the fact that some of the plugins can do unit-test while others can do static code analysis are just... awesome.I'm done.
