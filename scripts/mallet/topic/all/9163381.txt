Rubocop is an absolute pleasure to work with, but it also helps that the ruby community seems to have a more widely-agreed upon style guide than other communities (Javascript comes to mind). There are similar tools for Javascript, and I imagine many of them are configurable as well to cover most use cases. But with the diversity of Javascript style guides and the lack of cohesiveness in the js community, it seems unlikely that many of these would be as useful as rubocop 'out-of-the-box'.It would be amazing if a similar static code analysis tool existed with settings to conform to the most popular javascript style guides: npm, idiomatic, jQuery, etc. But even within these style guides there is a lot of 'undefined behavior', or situations that aren't explicitly described in the guides.
