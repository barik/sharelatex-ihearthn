> IDE's miss the point.No, because IDE are more than just coding.They offer an integration of services that one usually requires in large scale projects.I want:- semantic refactoring- background compilation as I type- static analysis- integration with bug tracking software and source control- visual debugging of data structures, threads- ability to change code during debbuging sessions- navigation of binary artifacts- debugging unit tests- semantic code navigation- GUI designers- XML build tools- visual navigation of databases- UML dual way generation- ...And above all, avoid trying to make Emacs or VIM do half of these features, every time I install them.
