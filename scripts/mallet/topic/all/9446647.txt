If they'd have called it a "static analyzer" they might have had an easier time selling it.  Businesses regularly shell out big bucks for C/C++/Java static analysis tools like Coverity, Klocwork, etc.Static analysis is less likely to yield fruit (design errors and not false positives) in a language like Python.  So the bar's definitely higher for these guys than it is for the static analysis tools for static-typed languages.
