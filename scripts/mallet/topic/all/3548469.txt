Well, with the exception of a class tree (which I've had trouble using in the past), those are all the reasons I just use a text editor. So, I guess I still don't understand.You see, I have file/project trees, warning/error buffers, build status and shells (among other things) in Vim and Emacs with keyboard-driven access to all the tools I use, without having to hunt through a twisty passage of menus, all alike.Even static analysis and error highlighting is available (even for C++ with vim-clang-complete, for example).So I guess what I don't understand is why there is a need for all of this to be "integrated" in a WIMP-style GUI.
