The backstory is pretty simple; I analyze malware and this was a sample.  It's difficult to talk about publicly because if you reveal too much, it's a chance for the malware authors to recognize they've been made and change what they're doing.What's interesting is that if you've seen enough samples, you can make educated guesses about the authors, their intentions, and level of competence.  In this case, the authors were obviously aware that someone might try to reverse engineer the software so they threw that little red herring in.  I have no idea why, and it was only in certain functions and not others.  But you do know the authors had a clue about IDA and similar static analysis tools and were trying to make it more painful to analyze.  It certainly wasted a couple of hours of my time.Fortunately the obfuscations make software like that easier to detect, so it's a balancing act the author has to play.If I ever stop analyzing malware there might be a very interesting blog series on all the boneheaded mistakes malware authors make when they obfuscate their code.  I could teach a six-month course on what not to do with crypto just from all the approaches I've seen.
