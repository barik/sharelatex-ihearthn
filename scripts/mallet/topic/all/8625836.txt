Well, here are some things that it does that other tools don't:- It type checks JSX
 - It supports some ES6 features others don't (like destructuring) as the build step
 - It has union types (TS will get those soon, already in master)
 - It does a lot more inference and a lot more assumptions. It assumes you won't multiply a string by a number for example (although technically '10' * 5 is legal in JS). So it's opinionated in that it enforces checks that rule out code that is legal but not likely intended in JS (an opinin I agree with).Yes - it is possible to write tests and get good coverage and not use those tools - however static analysis can be very valuable in finding errors early. While I'm not sure I'd bother with explicit typing in this in smaller projects from the examples and unit tests it looks like it could find errors people would not easily notice otherwise. (Think JSHint, on steroids).That said, only time will tell how good the implementation will really get in understanding your code.
