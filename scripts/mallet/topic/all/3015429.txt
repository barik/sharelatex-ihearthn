> [...] when you fire up Apples Xcode and start building CocoaTouch applications in Objective-C youre going to come face-to-face with a toolset that has not had the sort of love put into it that the open source community has put into the Java toolset and associate platforms, or that Microsoft has put into VS and .NET over the past 10 yearsI think I'd have to agree with this statement.  As someone who's recently started developing in Objective C and coming from a Java / Eclipse background, the toolset provided in Xcode seems to fall short of what Eclipse has to offer (I can't speak for Visual studio).For instance I don't think Xcode does proper static analysis.  I.e. it doesn't allow me to produce a proper class hierarchy for a class I'm using, nor can I run a command to see a call hierarchy on a method.  And refactoring isn't 100% accurate either, and also very limited, i.e. I can't extract methods from a code fragment, and also once extracted, move that method into another class without issue (typical workflow for extracting helper methods).It's not to say I can't do good work in Xcode.  I just have to be aware of it's limitations and keep accurate documentation as I code, instead of relying on the IDE for a lot of the heavy lifting.
