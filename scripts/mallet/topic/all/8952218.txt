Where I work we use SonarQube [1] for static code analysis. You can customize specific rule profiles for different projects and in the site they say it's available for many programming languages [2]. We only use it for Java so I don't know how good is the support for the other languages listed.My experience with these tools is that they are a great way to see how the code evolves during a project, help you keep it clean in maintenance mode, and may even teach you a couple of things about good coding practices. Just don't let it fall into the hands of management. They will love all those metrics and graphs, and soon enough you will have goals and performance reviews based on it.[1] http://www.sonarqube.org[2] http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Plugin+Library
