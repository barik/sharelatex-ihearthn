Automotive producers in general have pretty high standard of the source code creation and maintenance. However - the set of guidelines that govern the code - MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association), while better than nothing, are pretty poor. Most of MISRA rules look like they were designed to be easily checked by automated tools - not to check for real defects. That situation may have been acceptable 15 years ago, but modern static and dynamic analysis tools are capable of much more than that.
