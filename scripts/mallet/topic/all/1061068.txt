@jpluscplusm thanks for the feedback and good questions. Regarding the "what state is the codebase in" question, I can't imagine them telling me its "poor". What questions do you think would help me to gauge the quality of the code base? Obviously there is no formula, but it would be interesting to see what factors impact a codebase's quality. I guess there are static analysis tools to help out though :)
