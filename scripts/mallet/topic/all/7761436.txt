To me it seems the only way to smarter tools is static analysis, but there's only so much one can do in a dynamic language.There seems to be this dissonance between dynamic languages, which tend to be popular with new programmers for a variety of reasons, and better tools enabled by static analysis of (usually) static langues.The static languages seem to present this "hump" that a lot of people are averse to, and if we really want these smarter tools, we're going to have to find a way to get programmers to use more static techniques; we need to get them over that "hump", possibly then these smarter tools would ease things in the long run, but doesn't have quite the same immediate-gratification aspect of dynamic languages due to the up-front effort.
