Not sure about the overall proposal but static code analysis and code completion as a service is something I have been wishing for.But that is only for a selfish reason, it would save me from having to do the work for my own IDE HiveMind (crudzilla.com) :)*Perhaps this is something the Eclipse project should undertake, decouple the JDT from the Eclipse IDE so that it can be used by other developer front-end tools.
