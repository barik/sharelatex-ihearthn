>  The idea of having tools to parse and rewrite my code to be as generic as possible came to me years ago.You basically want an obfuscator that replaces all the names of things with generics, and then randomly permutes blocks of code without changing the code paths possible in the final binary. (Perhaps some optimized-for-performance version of this, but that might identify the tool you use.)It sounds relatively easy to write if you stick to certain coding guidelines (like using techniques amenable to static analysis).However, this still won't work in some cases, because you'd need more advanced tools to handle profiling of what sized functions and such you ended up writing.It would be interesting to try and write a tool which defeated any analysis of author patterns in the code, but would require understanding the program across the boundary of function calls, which is a difficult problem. (You probably couldn't write Turing complete code, for example.)
