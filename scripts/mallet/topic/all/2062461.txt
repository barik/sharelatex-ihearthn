Certainly possible, and teams can utilise off-the-shelf analytics tools to aid in the analysis (if that's allowed); however using this information beyond very simple adjustments (such as preflop) is very difficult. Also any deviation from a balanced strategy will open up the bot to counter-exploitation.As I say if dummy players are in there (playing easily exploitable passive or maniacal strategy) then I think there's good reason to implement an exploitive strat; otherwise the effort probably won't have the payoff amongst other static-strategy players.
