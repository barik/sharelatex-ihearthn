I've often felt that more developers (or even interested power users), should be running with things like MALLOC_CHECK_=3 (http://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=3113982) enabled by default for everything. On top of that, when we have plenty of FLOSS static analysis tools (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4545188), plus things like valgrind, gprof and gcov, I don't understand why more people don't use them. As for compiler flags, if we can build a whole distro around optimization (Gentoo), why can't we build a whole distro around debugging (-fstack-protector-all, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -g3, etc)? I realize some distros already enable things like this, but usually they are looking to harden things, not necessarily diagnose bugs.
