We are adding a number of measures to help prevent additional malicious applications using similar exploits from being distributed through Android MarketAm I the only one thinking they might be planning to leverage their recent acquisition of zynamics on this front? In particular, zynamics seems to have developed some tools[1] for classifying malware based on (as I understand it) some sort of static control-flow analysis. I'm far from an expert on the matter, but that sounds like it has some potential with regards to keeping malicious apps out of the Android Market.[1] http://www.zynamics.com/vxclass.html
