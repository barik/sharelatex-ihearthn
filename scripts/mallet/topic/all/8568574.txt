I presume you played with SonarQube? If not take a look, was very Java focused but is branching out, supports over 30 languages using an array of standard tools to do static code analysis.Pretty much SonarQube is the only tool I have found and it's somewhat annoying as a few plugins are commercial and very expensive. As you say, a plugin architecture would be great.I personally feel that in a few years time Code Analysis/Technical Debt tools will become standard as CI servers have.And for the doubters, of course no tool is going to tell you very precisely the true Technical Debt of a project but knowing how the code base is changing over time in terms of code count/complexity/todo count, etc I think is something every development team (+ management) should be pay attention to.
