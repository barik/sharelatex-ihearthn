>Sorry, but you obviously have not been taking notice over the past year or two.I'll admit, I haven't really, because I'll turn it round, why would I?We've seen Erlang start to be used quite a lot, Scala is becoming very interesting, and F# is appearing suitably mainstreme.What features would make me think "hmm, I should check out what they are doing in PHP"?Looking now I still see a cluttered array of APIs, some pretending they are C from the 80s, others hinting that they at least knew of objects in their design.A quick look for static analysis rule systems for say our CI system:
http://mark-story.com/posts/view/static-analysis-tools-for-p...Wow, that's pretty poor.What I do again see, are PHP developers who are not fluent in any other language.  I always find that odd.  For instance I've been doing mostly C# since version 2.  But I would probably pass most Java or CamL interview questions anyone had.  I am happy in C# knowing what I am missing from other languages (well, not happy, just its the right choice for the things I've been doing).In short, PHP has an image problem with plenty of people.  I am one of them.  They can't easily solve it, without breaking a whole bunch of existing code, as most of my complaints are inherent languages features and core API design (or lack there off).  I don't nock languages that eschew OO, but I do nock ones that implement it, just very, very badly.
