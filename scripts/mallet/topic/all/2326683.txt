Agreed.  Luatex makes the following division of labour practical: work with data structures and manipulate fonts and the backend in Lua, handle moving about text and setting parameters in the macro language.One thing I would like to see is proper static analysis tools for Luatex.  Lua has tools like https://github.com/fab13n/metalua/tree/master/src/samples/me... but there's nothing of comparable sophistication for Tex, let alone code combining the two, which makes debugging needlessly hard.
