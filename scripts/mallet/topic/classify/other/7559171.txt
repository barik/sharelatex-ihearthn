I don't think the NSA had to create this bug. I do think that static analysis could find this bug, and if they did not have the static analysis tools to do so, they probably will soon enough. It is far better for them to find existing bugs than introduce new ones, because the former is untraceable. The latter, inevitably, leaves a paper trail. I'd need a lot of convincing to believe that OpenSSL is so darned secure that it has no bugs in it until the NSA adds them, just based on the software engineering practices of the product (using C, little test code, etc).
