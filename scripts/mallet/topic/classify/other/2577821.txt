I would expect many of these tools to catch these types of bugs. The challenging thing for us has been to catch only bugs, and to catch them very fast during normal compilation.A lot of the static analyses we've looked into (and I'm hoping for more detailed blog posts about that in the future) find plenty of bugs, but also find lots of non-bugs. Combine that with being too slow to run during the normal build, and you can't break the build when such a bug is found.I think one of the most interesting aspects of this is how we catch the bugs early, and force developers to fix them immediately by breaking the build.
