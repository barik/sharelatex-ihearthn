My attitude towards developer tooling tends to be: build the tools first for the experts, and second make sure the are learnable.  I can't stand professional tools that are built primarily for new users.  Englebart's violin [0] and all that.That said, it might be the case that removing the responsibility of versioning from experts would make them less concerned about the ramifications, and less likely to notice when they make a change like this one (well not this one exactly, but one similar but more reasonable).You really do need tests in addition to static analysis to be sure of these things.[0]: http://www.loper-os.org/?p=861
