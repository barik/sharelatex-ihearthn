"but what is wrong with recursion? Why NASA guidelines prescribe to avoid simple technique we were studying as early as in school? The reason for that is static code analyzers NASA use to reduce the chance for error. Recursions make code less predictable for them. JavaScript tools do not have such a precept so what we can take out of this rule?"This is of course, wrong. Javascript has not solved the problem of making recursion easy or sane to analyze.  It is quite literally the same problem you have with C.In fact, most javascript tools are way less useful at recursion analysis (IE they produce a much higher rate of false positives) than C tools."9.The use of pointers should be restricted. Specifically, no more than one level of dereferencing is allowed. Function pointers are not permitted.This is the rule JavaScript developer can not get anything from.
"Except that javascript developers use function pointers like they were going out of style ...
