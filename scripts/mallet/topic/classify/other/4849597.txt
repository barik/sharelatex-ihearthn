Do you think better languages will make static analysis useless? I would think the combination to be better than better languages alone. Or are you arguing that static analysis by compilers should be improved (1) so far that separate tools for static analysis aren't useful anymore?(1) almost all compiled language systems do _some_ static analysis. For example, many compilers and linkers do dead code elimination, and Java and C# must, by spec, do static analyisis to prove that variables won't be used before set.
