Absolutely. If you're audited for MISRA compliance, you need to follow it point by point.The rules themselves are not meaningless or without a point, but there are a lot of companies that adopt MISRA without actually having (in the sense of audit and certification) to be compliant. Instead of focusing on the point of every provision, they rigidly follow them even when not applicable.But it can be worse, really. The gem of a coding standard we have at $work forbids not only goto, but also break, without MISRA's exception of one break per loop. And forbidding the use of goto and continue is cited as being done for readability reasons, rather than static analysis tools.
