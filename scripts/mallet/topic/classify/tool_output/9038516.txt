First of all the choice of C is because it was the language I was the most confidant writing secure code in. I'm not going to learn a new language and then right away start try to write secure code with it.Clang has some great tools I use like the various sanitizers. Static analysis sucks and almost never finds any real issues but we still use it.If you think toxcore should use protocol buffers, feel free to port it. This is an open source project and contributions are welcome. If you do a better job than me then I will merge your contribution. We are at #tox-dev on freenode.
