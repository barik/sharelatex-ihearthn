Accuracy. Detail. They have better analysis engines, which do more complex types of program analysis. The static program analysis field is incredibly deep it takes a lot of engineering to make a world class analysis engine. Just like it takes a lot of effort to make a world class optimising complier. (eg. the Intel C Compiler still out performs GCC despite monumental effort on GCC's side. It takes a long time to build this stuff)They also have better rules sets from what I understand than the open source tools.
