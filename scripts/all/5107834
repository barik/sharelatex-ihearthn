You get something in exchange to that overhead:1) predictability
2) static analysis
3) quality (static typeing vs. duck typing)
4) sophistication/maturity
5) reproducabilty
6) toolingAll that's not always necessary, but if you know the thing you're building has a shelf life of at least 2 years then ruby/rake are pretty shitty tools.
