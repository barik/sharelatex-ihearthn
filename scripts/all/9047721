It depends what you mean by "language" and what you include.Rust and Go include the compiler, the runtime, some libraries, some package management and some tutorials.Other things you might want include IDE support, static analysis tools, advanced garbage collectors, GUI toolkit (bindings), slick debugger support, monitoring and profiling engines. These will all add a large amount of time and money to the development of your new platform.
