Thanks to Jan Beulich, the SUSE Xen maintainer in Germany who is credited with finding this x86 HVM vulnerability.It would be helpful if errata announcements included documentation of the static analysis tools, code review process or automated testing techniques which identified the weakness, along with a postmortem of previous audits of relevant code paths.What made it possible for this issue to be identified now, when the issue escaped previous analysis, audits and tests? Such process improvement knowledge is possibly more valuable to the worldwide technical community than any point fix.Heartbleed was discovered by an external party, but this issue which affects the data of millions of users was found by the originating open-source project. Kudos to Jan for finding this cross-domain escalation.
