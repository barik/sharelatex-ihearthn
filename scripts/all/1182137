Regardless of anyone's opinions of this particular IDE / workflow it's been clear for a while that the future of developer tools will almost certainly include:- IDEs that take advantage of greater knowledge of code than just a simple organization of text files (e.g. reflection, call stacks, static and dynamic analysis, etc.)- Tying bug-tracking, automated testing, and source control together in a coherent way.- Generally merging the developer workflow into a seamless experience instead of a disjoint series of steps across N sets of distinct tools.Already we're seeing plenty of movement in this direction, with things like visual studio's intellisense, more in-IDE unit test tools, and the plethora of refactoring tools out there.The days of IDEs that do little more than compile and keep track of collections of files for you are numbered.
