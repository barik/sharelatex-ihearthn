So far I haven't used much manual code review, but I do use static code analysis to find possible bugs once in a while.Up until recently a big pain point for me was finding code which could block within a time constrained function (aka realtime safety). There weren't any tools out there, so I ended up making one with llvm named stoat[1] (originally static function property verification, sfpv). It's hard to say if this tool would really have wider usefulness as it essentially is just checking function attributes on the transitive closure of the callgraph, but it works for me.[1] https://github.com/fundamental/stoat
