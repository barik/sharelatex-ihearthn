I'm not buying these conclusions - on a quick scan, the "strange expression" isn't wrong: the code is scanning to find the first character that isn't a colon. The check against the zero byte is harmless, and I could imagine other static analysis tools insisting on it (as cheap insurance against scanning off-the-end).As for the "shifting negative integers is undefined behavior", this is a technically-true statement that's been practically-false for quite a few years - does anybody still use a machine that doesn't use two's-complement integers?
