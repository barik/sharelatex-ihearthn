I don't work for Apple and have never seen Xcode source, but my guess (based on what I would do) would be that Xcode invokes Clang/LLVM as libraries rather than a standalone binary, in order to keep persistent state. In principle GCC could present such an interface, but in practice FSF policies prevent it. The point is that the static analysis can be used directly or by other tools (there is a web interface, for instance); it is not restricted to Xcode.
