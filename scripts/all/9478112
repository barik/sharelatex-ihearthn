In my experience, the major problem with standards like MISRA is that people read the rules, but rarely the rationale behind them, which makes every coding standard end up encouraging cargo cult bug avoidance.Case in point: MISRA C forbids goto statements primarily because it can mess up static analysis. Yet this rule is gratuitously followed even when no static analysis tools are used, thus yielding none of the gains that you trade off for occasionally writing ugly code.
