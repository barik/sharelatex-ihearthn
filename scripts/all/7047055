In what way is asking someone, somewhere, to move a project to another, unnamed language, going to be more effective than actually starting a project and putting code into it? Sure, "go do it yourself" is not a pleasant response, but "go take the tens of thousands of lines of code that mostly works, and spend person-years rewriting it in another language so that a certain set of bugs aren't an issue anymore, instead of fixing the mostly working code" is in no way a reasonable request. "What can be done to help reduce the bug count, by a casual user?" might be. Contacting Coverity or another static analysis company that occasionally runs their tools on open source programs to help the world (and get the free press out of it...), might result in a huge list of subtle (and hideously obvious) bugs getting squashed.
