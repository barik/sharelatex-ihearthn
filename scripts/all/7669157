I'm not sure how that even follows from what I wrote.Note, I am all for extensive static analysis.  To the point that I am excited about such tools as Coverity and friends.I am beginning to take exception to requiring ever more from the programmer.  To the point that a programmer can't "in practice" specify a program correctly without a type checker.  (Which... is what the parent post says.  Right?)I would much rather have it such that "in practice" we can specify programs without help.  Since that implies that we can "in practice" read and reason about programs without extensive help, as well.
