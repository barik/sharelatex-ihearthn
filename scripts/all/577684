This is old news, obviously. It's worth pointing out that as good as the code appeared to these reviewers in 2004, between then and now, Microsoft underwent a sea change in code-level quality control. Windows is now likely to be the best reviewed, most rigidly compliant code shipping on the market:* Virtually every Microsoft senior developer has been trained on software security* All shipping code is checked in-house, including some homegrown static analysis tools* Most shipping products have had line-by-line source code reviews done by at least two different firms (we did some of this work for Vista).During the Summer of Worms in '03, when Microsoft security lapses were front-page material on CNN, Bill Gates told the press that Microsoft was going to totally overhaul security and code quality. They weren't kidding. Microsoft now outspends everybody on that.Note: I'm a Mac person.
