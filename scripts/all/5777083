Tern's static analysis is based loosely on SpiderMonkey's type inference, which does well with most JS libraries.Yes, some overloaded octopus methods fall back on Object. What helps the SpiderMonkey type-inference-driven JIT is online live-data profiling, as Marijn notes. This may be the crucial difference.However, new algorithms such as CFA2 promise more precision even without runtime feedback.And I suggest you are missing the bigger picture: TypeScript, Dart, et al., require (unsound) type annotations, a tax on all programmers, in hope of gaining better tooling of the kind you work on.Is this a good trade? Users will vote with their fingers provided the tools show up. In big orgs (Google, where Closure is still used to preprocess JS) they may, but in general, no.Renaming is just not high-enough frequency from what I hear to motivate JS devs to swallow type annotation./be
