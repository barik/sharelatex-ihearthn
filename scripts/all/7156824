Saying C is "very hard" is useful to dissuade the unprepared from writing buggy, vulnerable software, but for the experienced developer with modern tools, C is at worst "tedious".  Some simple habits, like always writing your malloc() and free() calls at the same time in balanced pairs, can make C quite managable.  Add valgrind, unit tests, and static analysis, and I'd have much more confidence in a good C program than an average program in a weakly typed language.
