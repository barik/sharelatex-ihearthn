Fun stuff, but again, doesn't come with any tools. Microsoft Typescript is much better on that matter.What javascript universe needs right now is not some more of syntactic sugar clusterfuck followed by debugging nightmare, but real tools, static code analysis. I don't want to waste my precious time dealing with closure compiler+scala something combo. \nIt's fun from programmers POV, but still it won't make me pay my bills!reality check, please
