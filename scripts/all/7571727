Your reimplementation would either be very different from the original, and hence not suffer the same bugs, or the compiler wouldn't get further than a couple of function calls before giving you a cryptic error message since it doesn't understand the control flow.Static analysis tools are useful for finding bugs in existing code, but safe programming languages won't magically point out all of the errors in some arbitrary code written in another language. They're safe precisely because they do not allow you to write code in the way that an unsafe language would.As an analogy, if you were looking for use-after-free errors in some C code, it wouldn't do you any good to check a Python version.
