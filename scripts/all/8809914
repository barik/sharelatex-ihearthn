>Imports shouldn't have side-effects (like registering functions with flask).Imports don't have side-effects. Using Flask's route decorators has.>You shouldn't use globals (like the flask app).The Flask app is just as much a global as any other class instance in any OOP language. Whether you make it a module-level object or not is your choice.>Objects (such as the flask app) should be immutable whenever possible.They hardly are. This is a good rule which nobody follows, and I don't think you'd gain enough advantages through this.>You need to make sure that you import every file with a request handler, and those imports often end up unused (only imported for their side-effects), which confuses linters and other static analysis tools.The fact that your app has import side-effects is your fault, this pattern is not at all encouraged by Flask. You probably want to use blueprints.
