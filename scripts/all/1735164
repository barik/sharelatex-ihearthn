Thanks for the clarification. Given the way this cycle is bound to repeat, do you see any mileage in attempts to use typed assembly languages or other static analysis tools on things like the kernel? I've never seen them as worthwhile for application software, but they could definitely prevent this kind of bug, and if current techniques aren't stopping these bugs, then would it be worth the investment?
