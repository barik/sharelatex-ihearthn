I would (almost) completely disagree with this.C++ support in VS is horrible, that's correct, but having the ability to be supported by compiler services that can parse (invalid) code is a major milestone when it comes to handling more complex codebases.It does not matter how smart you are, the easier it is for you to understand and reason about the code, the more will fit in your head.Refactoring is just one of the many amazing tools that make me a much better and more productive programmer today then I was without when using vi in the 90s. Add in static analysis, intellisense etc... Every bit of complexity that tooling can hide from you is worth gold.Reality for C++ is grim though in this regard. Let's hope we get better compiler services for it soon.
