Well, just so we're clear: I buy the idea of using Haskell or OCaml for static code analysis (in fact, one of the better known static analyzer tools, which operates on binary control flow graphs, is written in OCaml).What I don't buy is the idea that the Haskell runtime actually improves SQL or HTML security. By all means, write a Haskell source analyzer. It will help. But a web app stack written in Haskell will presumably have the same problems (or lack thereof) that Rails does.Mathematical reasoning, for what it's worth, doesn't have a great track record in systems security. ;)
