The source code to Windows, while not public, is some of the best studied in the world both inside and out of Microsoft. Even though MSFT doesn't publish it, they do release complete debug symbols for most of the operating system; there isn't a pro vulnerability researcher on the Internet that can't navigate Windows with a copy of IDA Pro and a couple of PDBs. The openness of the Windows source code is a red herring.Meanwhile, most bugs aren't discovered in careful source code review or by static analysis tools. Instead, we write programs to exercise the code, either by sending random dumb buffers to the target or by working out the expected format and varying messages until we cover every basic block in the target. You can do this with or without any source code.I think you would have a hard time finding a professional to say that they trust Mac OS X dramatically more than they trust WinAPI in 2010, and I say this as a full-time Mac user.
