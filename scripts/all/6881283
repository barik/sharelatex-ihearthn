> For my single-threaded code I have great static analysis tools, IDE magic, and testing frameworks. For my multi-threaded code, I'm on my own...That's a big point.  The tooling for parallel code is developing really slowly compared to the proliferation of multi-core processors.  Most of it seems to be "we'll make the library multi-threaded but all your code will still be single-threaded" like we see in Node.
