The word on the street in the Haskell community is that what you say is definitely true in many places, but Haskell makes inroads by being pretty fast if not C fast, grabbing Excel interaction [1], and building banking-related DSLs [2]. The typical story is that the Haskell shop builds advanced tools atop Excel, analysts get excited and want more, then the Haskell shop teaches them just enough Haskell to run a pricing DSL. Static types make it so that relatively untrained programmers can still manipulate the DSL adroitly.All that to say not that Haskell is going to beat Java/C++ in any visible time frame but instead to compare its use favorably with something like Python.[1] See Paradise, Credit Suisse's Excel interop library (http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/accepted/37.html)[2] http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers...
