It's super cool to see the power of advanced static analysis these days. Props to the Coverity team for using the Heartbleed trainwreck to motivate new research on these problems.That said, are there other ways to fix this class of problem? We have choices. We can continue to build ever-more-advanced tools for patching over the problems of C and C++, or we can start using languages that simply do not have those problems.There will always be a need for C and C++ in device drivers, microcontrollers, etc. But there's no compelling reason why SSL implementations in 2014 should use languages designed to run on mainframes in 1973.
