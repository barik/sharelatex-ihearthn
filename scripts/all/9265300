Great work, looks very nice. Will give it a whirl when I get home.In the meanwhile, I noticed that you support intellisense. What are the limitations to this? What patterns will get correctly picked up? I assume prototypal inheritance will work fine (of course), but will any of the BaseClass.extend()-style inheritance mechanisms that some frameworks seem to favour (e.g. Backbone) work?While we're at it, is the static analysis tools you built for this public? I'd love to have a look at them.
