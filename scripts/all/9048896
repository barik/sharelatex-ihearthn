You missed the whole point.By making the language simple you can easily implement your own parser. This opens up the ability to write native parsers in other languages, say vimscript. By keeping it super simple there -are- no corner-cases.There are many benefits to this (like the formatters etc that others have alluded to) from things like IDE integration (imagine lifetime elision visualisation, invalid move notifications, etc) static analysis tools and more. None of these tools then need to be written in Rust. It also means it's easier to implement support in pre-existing multi-language tools.Don't underestimate the necessity of a simple parseable grammar. Besides, people have endured much worse slights in syntax (see here Erlang).
