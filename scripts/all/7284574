The vp of engineering should have invested in a good static analysis tool which would have spotted this section in about five seconds. Failing that turning on a sensible set of defaults in the compiler (warning about unreachable code) would have also drawn attention to it.There are many many ways this should have been caught before it even left the building by numerous automated tools. Heck most modern IDEs will flag unreachable code in the editor so there is no real excuse for this. (Adding -Wunreachable-code to a sample project in Xcode immediately flags the next line).The programmer is human which is why automated verification tools exist.(AppCode's default inspections will also flag the issue providing you run them)
