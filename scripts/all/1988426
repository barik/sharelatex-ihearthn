there's always been a lot of debate about whether software engineering is part of computer science or a separate profession.looking at it through my own personal lens ... PREfix and PREfast (the static analysis tools i architected) were primarily software engineering -- we published in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering.  others working in the same space took more of a computer science approach, developed far more precise models and made breakthroughs in SAT and BDD.  over time the two streams merged, which is a big win all around.on the other hand, some of my other work was very CS-y -- looking at formalizing security algebras, for example, and applying standpoint epistemology to graph theory.  so in the end i consider myself both a computer scientist and a software engineer.
