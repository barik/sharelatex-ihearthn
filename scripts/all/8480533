As well as being the author of the algorithms in NaCl, djb is also a specialist in secure software development, as tptacek mentioned.You can be reasonably sure that his code is bug free, but they went the extra step of proving the absence of certain types of bugs using static analysis tools. One of the project's deliverables mentioned they used Frama-C to prove the absence of integer overflows, for example. (I will update this comment when I find the specific report.)Other projects take the traditional approach of trusting that the code looks right until someone proves otherwise.Edit: The report was probably one of these, which I can't access anymore:http://www.cace-project.eu/downloads/deliverables-y1/CACE_D5...
