> I don't know of legitimate websites that obfuscate their JS. (Minification doesn't count.)What exactly is the difference between obfuscation and minimization?  Could you write a program to tell the difference between a JS file that's been benevolently minified versus maliciously obfuscated?  For that matter, how do humans tell the difference between minification and obfuscation?I think that, if you define "obfuscation" as "transforming source code into a less readable form," then most automatic program transformations -- especially those specifically intended to reduce the size of the resulting code -- will also be obfuscations.Of course, if only malware authors would make their products comply with RFC 3514, these problems would go away; security sandboxes and antimalware programs could simply and effectively filter based on the intent of a program's author, rather than static or dynamic analysis of the program's code [1].[1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3514
