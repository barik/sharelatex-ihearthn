As a part of the build system at my work, we run various passes over the code aside from just "does this compile". I'm sure these MOOCs could find software to:1. Check style of a language2. Run a comprehensive suite of unit tests3. Static analysis of the codeThese tools together can catch most problems of bad formatting, fragile code (cannot handle edge cases, errors, etc.), and structural errors. Additionally you could take into account some kind of performance of the code - does this solve this problem in a reasonable amount of time?By using standard industry tools, one could do a good grading system that is entirely automated.
