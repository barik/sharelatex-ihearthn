How much code reuse is there between the firmware in a manufacturer's different car models? I'm surprised there isn't a consortium (like Symbian was) to create a standard firmware kernel to share the benefits (and costs) of testing and auditing the code.I'm also surprised C is still so commonly used for mission critical software. I understand that C is familiar, has many static analysis tools (to make up for the language's deficiencies), and has a straight-forward translation from C to object code (though only when using simple optimizations). For example, if MISRA-C's coding guidelines disallow recursion, why not design a language that only supports DAG function dependencies?
