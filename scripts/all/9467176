Poor practices are more common among front-end developers, partly due to people coming in from non-programming fields (graphic design, for example) and partly due to people who should know better saying "it's JavaScript, JavaScript sucks, fuck it, I'm not responsible."Don't get sucked in to the JS blame game. There are many excellent tools and libraries available (e.g., Karma for cross-browser testing; JSHint for static analysis; npm for installing and updating packages) and good practices are entirely possible. Keep up the good fight.I have a screencast series on this topic at http://www.letscodejavascript.com (subscription required) and an essay on tooling and workflow at http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/blog/2015/02/javascript...
