My main hypothesis, which I of course never said, is that current static analysis tools should be able to catch the majority of these cases anyway.  Especially the ones that matter.That is, a type system is not the only tool we have in static analysis.  So, I'm not completely convinced that moving to a type system is the best way to go.Granted, it large part, it is clear it doesn't matter "what I think."  Statically typed languages have a massive amount of support.
