Thanks for the answer.  I'm curious about the implication that there aren't any mature static analysis tools that catch all undefined behavior and memory access to potentially invalid or mis-typed objects.  I expect such tools technically could exist but don't know if they actually do.I might not understand what you mean regarding positive human action when talking about using static analysis tools -- are you referring to tools that require a manual process to run and evaluate, rather than having your tools outright fail to produce a program if static analysis isn't completely happy with the source code?
