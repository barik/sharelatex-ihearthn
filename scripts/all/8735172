> There will always be people to say that doing things manually is better than having the computer do itLanguages that don't require a heavy IDE (particularly one including lots of tools for writing and rewriting code -- static analysis tools are a different issue) aren't "doing things manually instead of having the computer do it" -- interacting with the language itself is no more "manual" than interacting directly with the IDE. Its just aligning the write-language with the read-language. If I need a separate visual language to use to write code from the language I'm nominally working in, that both increases the overall mental complexity and indicates that there are weaknesses in the abstractions available in the nominal working language.
