Hi, thanks for replying.> The paper reports overhead numbers from existing research. For instance, see Figure 18 in http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1411, which shows the cost of SC for memcached - 1% on x86 and 3% on ARM.But that's the bit I don't find nearly convincing enough. You say (p.5) that you're going to "rebut these arguments" that "SC is too expensive", but the main figure of 1%/3% is from a non-standard research-level static analysis tool that, if I read that paper correctly, works on codes up to 10k LOC and takes a few minutes to run, producing the 1%/3% figure. Can that really be generalised? I'm not quite sure. The other tools in comparison did much worse, which I think may be closer to what one would get in practice. So I think that's not a good rebuttal: if you consider the tools actually available SC may well be too expensive.I'm not saying you're wrong, just that I don't think you've proven your case very clearly. I was kind of expecting a much clearer rebuttal than I found, sorry about the snark.
