yeah I agree #8 in particular should elicit a lot more debate in the js community. Back when I used to be into RoR I would get a ton of flack in interviews for writing pure js rather than Coffeescript, pure css rather than Sass.There are legitimate cases where a pre-processor is useful (Coffeescript demos show several cases where a lot of code can be simplified) but unless you are writing a math/list-heavy app, I feel these advantages don't apply so much. I don't perceive a need for these tools in most projects that are about dom manipulation, it can instead be achieved through pure libs (jQuery) which will eliminate a build step and should allow for some easier testing.This is a fundamental programming debate that I don't see a lot of discussion of... since I like CLojure I see some talk of how "transparent" it is as a wrapper over JVM types but a lot of the pre-processor style of transcompilers gloss over this idea (I guess just preferring 2 independent stages of static/lint analysis?).
