Well said.  rms is still The Man as far as I'm concerned.  So bash had a bug, big whoop-do-freaking-do... I guess Windows or Internet Explorer or ActiveX or Firefox or Chrome or Opera or Java or Flash never had exploitable bugs; oh, wait....The takeaway from all this, to me, is simply to acknowledge that while "with enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow" may or may not be true, there's no easy way to know, a priori, how many eyeballs are "enough" - and Open Source projects (right alongside ALL software projects) should still utilize tools like static code analysis, fuzzing tools, should still have dedicated security audits from time to time, etc.The other takeway is that "defense in depth" is still mantra number one for security. You can have a hole at any level, which means that every level must work to limit access to the greatest possible extent.  A hope and prayer and expecting all software to be bug-free isn't going to cut it.
