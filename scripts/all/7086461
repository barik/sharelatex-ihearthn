"Part of it is due to the very strict Python standard of coding."I don't know about that. Good code is good code. It's sort of one of those, "I'll know it when I see it" things.The ease of which you can code classes for the sake of classes in Python can make some really hairy code out of what should be simple programs. Was that necessarily the 'one right way to do it'? Who's to say. And all the static analysis tools and syntactic aren't going to undo those hairballs anytime soon.You might just feel more comfortable with languages with lower code density. 'brandonbloom made a good blog about that[1]. I think it can be doubly applied to any situation where meta-programming is employed.1: http://www.brandonbloom.name/blog/2013/06/24/code-density/
