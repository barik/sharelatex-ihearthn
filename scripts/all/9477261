The C ecosystem has tools designed to compensate for its issues.  There's valgrind, static analysis, debuggers, asan, tsan, etc..  With its immense popularity, its flexibility and portability, and its mature, comprehensive ecosystem behind it, there's no all-purpose programming language better than C (expect maybe C++).
