I haven't. I'd like links, though. If I can see with my eyes that code will never be executed, I'd like to know what's wrong with the state of current static analysis.edit: http://blog.veracode.com/2014/02/do-not-pass-qa-do-not-goto-...Veracode does static analysis of the binary, and says that it would be thwarted because it wouldn't know that some functions were meant to be called. Static code analysis would tell you that it was impossible for some of the code to be run.edit 2:(the second comment on the vericode blog)caf | February 24, 2014 11:05 pmIn the Evil Unit Tests part you can use code coverage tools to at least verify that your unit tests exercise all code paths. It wonâ€™t catch every bug, but it would have caught this one.
