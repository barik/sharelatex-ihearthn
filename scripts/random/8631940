That's kind of what compilers are for. One of their jobs is static analysis. They have the graphs needed for hoisting. Libraries don't.This may be a problem with the existing compiler, if the Rust implementation is mostly a front-end to LLVM.  I'd hate to see "unsafe" code baked into the language standard, though.  C++ tried to fix the mess underneath with template libraries.  That didn't end well."Giving programmers low-level tools when they need them" as an excuse for abandoning language safety is a recipe for bad code.  There's a long, long history of that not working.  "Unsafe" code should be very, very rare, used for dealing with device registers and such.This sounds like designing buffer overflows into Rust.
