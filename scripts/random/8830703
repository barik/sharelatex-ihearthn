>Automating restarts / Automatic browser refreshI don't think this is very beneficial when your project's complexity grows enough to require a non-trivial build. It's nice to have for simple projects, of course.> Using control flow modules (such as async)In my experience the async module creates verbose and ugly looking code. In almost all cases promises are a better solution. Of course, even promises are pretty ugly as it's a "hack" to solve a problem at the language level. ES7 proposal includes async/await, maybe that'll finally solve this problem.>Not using static analysis toolsI'd also recommend checking out TypeScript and tslint for complex Node.js applications.
