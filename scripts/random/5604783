As much as people feel negatively about Java, it really has fantastic static code analysis tools.My first experience with Java was at a job in high school... and my only reference was a book that weighed half as much as I did.  Needless to say it left me with a very, very poor impression of the language, which I'm only recently learning is very much wrong.I definitely prefer writing Python, but the more I actually learn about Java, the worse I feed for being such a senseless detractor for so many years.
