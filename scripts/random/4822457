Great advice if you want to optimize for salary.Most of this stuff I learned from the streets and I've done pretty well following it.However I've reached a point where a bigger salary, better benefits, and equity offers won't cut it for me anymore.  There's a hidden nugget in this article that suggests that there are things in life outside of work which are better sources of happiness.  One of the sources it fails to mention is accomplishment and achievement.  If you are a programmer that spends their time reading the latest research, crafting your skills by implementing a compiler for some exotic language you're interested in, and following your passion then you will find optimizing your career by writing CRUD forms for an accounting package for 8+ hours a day to be an incredible waste of time and energy.(It's also incredibly hard to develop a source of accomplishment and achievement if you spend the majority of your life being bored)I've once heard the advice that you should optimize for happiness and great things will begin to happen.  If modelling weather simulations is what turns your crank you will never be happy building web APIs to a legacy CRM system.  If you enjoy pushing the envelop of static analysis then what good are you doing for the world hacking on a javascript front-end for a client at a creative agency?  Rather than optimizing for salary you optimized your life around what motivates you and makes you happy then perhaps we'd have better weather predictions and early warning systems for tropical storms or better tools that allow us to write safer, faster, bug-free code.  The icing on the cake is that you'd be happy to do it.If you're just getting out of school though, then I'd follow the advice in this article for a while first.  You don't know where to go without getting a lay of the land first.  And a good salary will help you build up a "screw-up" fund for when you're ready to take the dive and follow your calling.
