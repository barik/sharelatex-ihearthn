My personal observation is that while compilers continually get better at identifying straightforward mistakes, they don't have the same capability as a static analysis tool that works across compilation units. That is the real selling point of these tools. Definitely -Weverything/-Wexta plus static analysis for baseline checking.My other beef is that compilers always add new warnings as options or behind new "catch all" flags like -Weverything that no one knows about. As long as each new warning can be individually disabled, there isn't a huge cost to pay by making much more of them enabled by default. Upgrading to a new compiler version usually requires a tiny bit of work, so adding a few -Wno-* rules for new things you want to disable until the code is clean (or forever) is a small price to pay for all new code getting the checks by default.
