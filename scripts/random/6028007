i've been coding in python professionally for 4 years now, and i'm currently working on the biggest project i've ever worked on.
to me, being scared of changing the signature of a function because the static analyser will not be able to spot all the places i've used this function is a real problem ( along with incomplete autocomplete ). i do unit test everything, but i'd like to keep unit tests for things a computer can not theorically do.since i'm still in the early phase of the project, i know that python expressiveness is an edge, but i'm looking right now at what's going to be the "definitive" language i'm going to rebuild my product for the next 3 to 4 years.Python badly needs optional typing. really. i'm pretty sure that would solve both the speed and tooling issues. right now, for me, it starts to become unsuitable as soon as you reach 5-10k lines of code and a team of 2.
