LLVM is designed to be more than just a compiler. It's different stages can be used separately by other code, making it well suited for building things like static analysis tools. Apple (sponsor and de facto leader of LLVM) has been taking advantage of this to integrate clang-based static analysis into XCode, the proprietary IDE that ships with Mac OS X. Even if GCC had a clean enough architecture to be used this way, the licensing restrictions would force all of XCode to be open-sourced.
